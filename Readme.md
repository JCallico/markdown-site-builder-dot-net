# Markdown Site Builder

Markdown Site Builder will be a multi-platform, multi-tenant and convention based website rendering engine using Markdown files as source.

## Idea

I have used many Web Content Management Systems (CMS) over the years and have always stop using them for at least one of the following reasons:

1- Most CMS contain many more features than I need, specially when working on a documentation site.

2- In most cases, a relational database is required which increases the hosting costs, maintenance, backup, etc.

3- Difficulty to either edit or publish content.

While I realized that some of the reasons above have gotten easier and easier, I still want want a much simpler application that won't get in the way of the process of creating and publishing content for the Web.

## Concept

When creating documentation or content in general nothing beats Markdown, in my opinion.

I want a simple site builder engine that will allow me to:

1. Write all the content of the site using the Markdown editor of my choice.

2. Define the site structure by simply organizing the Markdown files into folders.

3. Publish the site content by simply copying the files using FTP (or equivalent).

4. Be able to host the site in Windows or Linux.

5. Be able to have multiple content sites on a single host.

6. Favor convention over configuration when rendering the site content into HTML.

## Requirements

1. .Net Core (version TBD)
